Processes and Approach:

1. Draw out wireframes and user stories
2. Scaffold out components and component heirarchy and structure, including routes and links.
3. Decide where state will live (root component, <App /> component.
4. Put together fetch call and make sure data is being correctly extracted from Google Books API.
5. Implement Context API so I can manage state and avoid prop drilling.
6. Add event listeners and attach to event handlers to update state properly and where it is needed for data coming in from API.
7. Put together structure of API data in components.
8. Add event listeners and handlers to update Google Books data into <ReadingList /> component.
9. Handle edge cases and errors (invalid search entry, no search entry).
10. Implement render and unit testing.
